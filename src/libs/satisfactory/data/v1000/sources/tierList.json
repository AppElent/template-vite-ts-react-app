You'll also see a huge increase in items, buildings, and power use (10%). You do get to use an Assembler instead of a Manufacturer, but you'll have to make more Cooling Systems to do it. I couldn't even get this recipe to work in any min-max setup. I think it will get buffed later."

        "notes": "Compared to Silicone Circuit Board, this increases items, buildings, and power use (12%) overall. You have to introduce a new item (Petroleum Coke) to your production line, and it eats Oil like nobody's business. It saves a little Copper over the original recipe. It's also being compared to two great alternatives (scores over 90), which doesn't help its case."
